There are two versions: 

-older slower one that should work on any phone without additional software (uses ADB screenshot for image grabbing and ADB input for sending events to device) [see TESTS/main_screencap.py, not updated in a while since it just works...slowly]

-newer faster one (image grabbing using Minicap app on phone + RemoteKeyboard app on phone for keyboard input) [the main one]

## Tested phones:
Sony ST27i ( Xperia go )
